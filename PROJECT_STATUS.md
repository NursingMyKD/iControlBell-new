- `AccessibilityUtils.swift` - VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, accessibility scaling

#### Documentation:
- `RUNNING_THE_APP.md` - Complete setup and deployment guide
- `RESPONSIVE_DESIGN.md` - Technical implementation details

## 🔧 REQUIRED USER ACTION

### Add Utility Files to Xcode Project
The utility files exist in the filesystem but need to be added to the Xcode project:

1. Open `iControlBell.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Right-click `iControlBell/utils/` folder in Project Navigator
3. Select "Add Files to 'iControlBell'"
4. Add these files:
   - `iControlBell/utils/DeviceUtils.swift`
   - `iControlBell/utils/AccessibilityUtils.swift`
5. Ensure "Add to target: iControlBell" is checked

## 📱 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### Responsive Design Features:
- **Adaptive Grid Layouts**: Dynamic column counts based on device and orientation
- **Dynamic Spacing**: Device-specific spacing that scales with accessibility settings
- **Font Scaling**: Responsive typography with Dynamic Type support
- **Touch Target Optimization**: Minimum 44pt touch targets for accessibility
- **Orientation Support**: Optimized layouts for portrait and landscape modes

### Accessibility Features:
- **VoiceOver Compatibility**: Proper accessibility labels and hints
- **Dynamic Type Support**: Text scaling based on user preferences
- **High Contrast Support**: Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile confirmation for user interactions
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user motion sensitivity preferences

### Healthcare-Specific Features:
- **Large Touch Targets**: Easy interaction for users with motor difficulties
