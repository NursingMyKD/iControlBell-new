# Privacy & Security Compliance

This app is designed for healthcare environments and follows best practices for privacy and security:

- **No Cloud Storage:** All patient data and activity remain on the device. No data is sent to external servers.
- **Bluetooth Security:** BLE connections are only established with authorized, paired hospital call bell systems. All BLE data is encrypted in transit.
- **No Personal Data:** The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Audit Logging:** All Bluetooth connection attempts and call activations are logged locally for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Accessibility:** The app is fully accessible and supports VoiceOver, large touch targets, and high-contrast UI.
- **Source Code Review:** The codebase is modular, readable, and easy to audit for compliance.

For further compliance documentation or to adapt to specific hospital requirements, see the README and consult your compliance officer.
