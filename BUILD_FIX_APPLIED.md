# Build Issue Resolution

## Problem
The project was experiencing "Multiple commands produce" errors during build, affecting multiple Swift source files:

```
error: Multiple commands produce '/Users/.../Objects-normal/arm64/CallRequestOption.stringsdata'
error: Multiple commands produce '/Users/.../Objects-normal/arm64/AppState.stringsdata'
error: Multiple commands produce '/Users/.../Objects-normal/arm64/iControlBellApp.stringsdata'
... and many more
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by duplicate `Assets.xcassets` directories:
- `/Assets.xcassets` (root level - duplicate)
- `/iControlBell/Assets.xcassets` (correct location)

Both asset catalogs were being included in the build target, causing Xcode to process the same resources multiple times and generate duplicate build artifacts.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed the duplicate root-level `Assets.xcassets` directory**
   - The root-level directory only contained `AppIcon.appiconset/`
   - The correct location at `iControlBell/Assets.xcassets` contains the full structure:
     - `AccentColor.colorset/`
     - `AppIcon.appiconset/`
     - `Contents.json`

2. **Verified project structure**
   - Main target includes two `fileSystemSynchronizedGroups`:
     - `iControlBell/` (source code)
     - `Resources/` (resource files)
   - No overlapping files between these directories

## Project Structure (After Fix)
```
/workspaces/iControlBell-new/
├── iControlBell/
│   ├── Assets.xcassets/          ✅ Correct location
│   ├── iControlBellApp.swift
│   ├── models/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── bluetooth/
│   ├── state/
│   └── utils/
├── Resources/
│   ├── CallRequestOptions.plist
│   ├── SoundboardCategories.plist
│   ├── Localizable.strings
│   └── Sounds/
└── iControlBell.xcodeproj/
```

## Next Steps
To verify the fix:
1. Open the project in Xcode on macOS
2. Clean the build folder (Product → Clean Build Folder)
3. Build the project (⌘+B)

The "Multiple commands produce" errors should no longer occur.

## Environment Note
This fix was applied in a Linux codespace environment where Xcode is not available. The build cannot be tested here, but the structural fix should resolve the issue when the project is opened in Xcode on macOS.
